Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota, where I am advised by Dr. Keisha Varma. I am currently pursuing a PhD focused on the development of web-based science curricula intended to develop the argumentation skills of middle school science students. In the past year, I successfully defended my Master's thesis which consisted of an examination of cognitive processing language use in asynchronous online discussion forums. 

On this website, you'll find a copy of my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://bulla049.github.io//files/Bullard_CV_April2024.pdf), a selection of my [scholarly publications](https://bulla049.github.io//publications/), and the occasional blog post. If you'd like to connect, please be sure to use one of the links in the sidebar and I would be happy to respond (note I am most responsive via email).
