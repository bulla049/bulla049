# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam Bullard (he/him). I am a graduate student at the University of Minnesota under the advisement of Dr. Keisha Varma in pursuit of a PhD in Educational Psychology. Specifically, my work is centered around the development of middle school science curricula which fosters the growth of learners' argumentation skills. In the past year, I successfully defended my Master's thesis on cognitive processing language usage in asynchronous online discussion forums.

On this website, you'll find a copy of my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://bulla049.github.io//files/Bullard_CV_April2024.pdf), a selection of my [scholarly publications](https://bulla049.github.io//publications/), and the occasional blog post. If you'd like to connect/collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me using any of the links provided in the sidebar - although you may have the best luck in reaching out directly via email (bulla049@umn.edu).
