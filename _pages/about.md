## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam Bullard (he/him). 

I am a graduate student at the University of Minnesota currently seeking out a PhD in Educational Psychology, under the advisement of Dr. Keisha Varma. In the past year, I successfully defended my Master's thesis which analyzed the use of cognitive processing language in asynchronous online discussion forum posts. 

Broadly speaking, my primary research interests include scientific argumentation, socioscientific issues, natural language processing techniques, and technology-enhanced science instruction. My current work is focused on the development of middle school science curricula emphasizing core scientific practices such as engaging in argument from evidence. 

On this website, you'll find a copy of my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://bulla049.github.io//files/Bullard_CV_April2024.pdf), a selection of my [scholarly publications](https://bulla049.github.io//publications/), and the occasional blog post. 

If you'd like to connect/collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me using any of the links provided in the sidebar - although you may have the best luck in reaching out directly via email (bulla049@umn.edu).
